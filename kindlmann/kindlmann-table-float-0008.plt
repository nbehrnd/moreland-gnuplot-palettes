# Kenneth Moreland suggested diverging palettes (e.g., transient blue ->
# white -> red) in 'Diverging Color Maps for Scientific Visualization'
# (2009).  Illustrated details are provided on.[1]  Different to the ones
# (still) 'typically used' the color definitions in these are less bright.
#
# Bastian Rieck provided a map of 256 levels including the line styles
# below which is used as a reference here.[2]  He correctly speculated
# gnuplot's dying maps depends on the number of the levels explicitly
# defined in the .plt.  This change was recognized with synthetic data,
# the Bessel function of
#
# f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2
#
# plot as 2D map with different palette definitions.  The .png eventually
# were compared with Imagemagick's compare routine.
#
# Note that for blue -> white -> red diverging maps, Moreland suggests two
# types of palettes:
#
# + type 'Smooth Cool Warm'.  This is 'a map with a smooth transition in
#   the middle to prevent artifacts at the midpoint'. (loc. cit.)
# + type 'Bent Cool Warm'.  Here, 'the luminance is interpolated linearly
#   with a sharp bend in the middle. This makes for less washed out colors
#   in the middle, but also creates an artifact at the midpoint.'
#
# On occasion the RGB might exceed the range of [0,1]; these files are
# identified with RGB_check.py.  Rounding to just two decimals will allow
# more .plt to pass the check by RGB_check.py, yet on expense of quality
# (see the 'RGB decomposition', by gnuplot's /test palette/ instruction.)
#
# To work with the .plt in gnuplot, either copy the definitions into the
# gnuplot script, or access their information with a
#
# load example.plt
#
# instruction prior to the [s]plot command.
