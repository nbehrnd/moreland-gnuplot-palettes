This folder demonstrates the outcome processing the Bessel function
f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 with Kenneth Moreland's color palettes (based on
RGB definitions with floating numbers about 512 explicitly defined
colors) with script palette_test_pdf.py set to 256 iso samples
gnuplot has to consider while generating .pdf files.  This is to
complement ab analogue scrutiny aiming to deposit the results in
bitmap .png /via/ gnuplot's pngcairo terminal.

Palette types considered wit the following palette definitions, listed
in alphabetic order:

+ bent-cool-warm-table-float-0512
+ black-body-table-float-0512
+ extended-black-body-table-float-0512
+ extended-kindlmann-table-float-0512
+ kindlmann-table-float-0512
+ magma-table-float-0512
+ plasma-table-float-0512, and
+ viridis-table-float-0512.

In each case, the RGB floating numbers provided by Kenneth Moreland's
palette definitions were rounded to 5 (five) decimals.
