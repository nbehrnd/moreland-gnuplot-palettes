* Background

  On his web page, Kenneth Moreland suggests a number of continuous
  and diverge color palettes to improve scientific
  visualization.[fn:1] Contrasting to other approaches, they aim for a
  smooth variation of the hue between the extremes of a scale
  displayed.  While this reduces the brightness of the colors to
  choose from, their continuous transient hue offers a better visual
  inspection already when print in color.  Contrasting to classical
  "jet" or "rainbow" palettes (/vide infra/), they retain their
  information if the output is constrained to gray scale (e.g., if
  xeroxed).

  Where possible, this project renders Kenneth Moreland's set of
  =.cvs= palette information accessible to gnuplot as =.plt= files.

* How to use the .plt palettes

  The color palettes are provided with a varying number of explicitly
  defined colors.  This range spans from eight up to 1024.  For
  smaller color palettes, a copy-paste of their content into an
  already existing gnuplot script file may be an option.  More
  convenient however, especially while working with larger color
  palettes, is to access them from gnuplot by adding the command
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    load "example_palette.plt"
  #+END_SRC
  at any point prior to the =[s]plot= instruction.

  Each sub-folder contains the corresponding =.plt= files.  The number
  in the file name indicates the number of explicitly defined colors
  in the file.

* Palettes at disposition

  For the display of continuous data, conversions of eight color
  palettes are provided: =black-body=, =extended-black-body=,
  =inferno=, =kindlmann=, =extended-kindlmann=, =magma=, =plasma=, and
  =viridis=.

  On the other hand, palette =bent-cool-warm= is designed with diverge
  data sets in mind where highlighting the transition across a
  critical value is important.  This may be useful to indicate
  relative velocities, or pressures below / above a threshold, for
  example.  It is complemented by =smooth-cool-warm=.  While again
  designed as diverging palette, the transition around the mid point
  now is gradual.  Thus, for data close at this transition, expect
  less detail displayed there with with palette =smooth-cool-warm= ,
  than with palette =bent-cool-warm=. \\ 

  The display of the palette's action is based on synthetic data
  computed for the Bessel function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ with a grid of
  500 \times 500 points in the (/x,y/)-plane.  1024Â levels in the
  orthogonal /z/-direction accommodate the highest number of
  explicitly defined colors per palette file available ($n = 1024$).
  Next to it, a diagram depicts how the =R=, =G=, and =B= channel sum
  up to yield the =RGB= color displayed.  In addition, the NTSC
  luminance value is traced.  This is indicative about how the
  calculated result would look like for an output constrained to
  gray-scale.  Thirdly you see the Bessel plot a twice, actually
  simulating the gray-scale output.

* Comparison with other palettes
  
  A few palettes are compared to those provided by Moreland.  They
  again rely on the high level of isosamples (=set iso 1024=) in /z/-,
  and samples (=set samples 500=) in /x/- and /y/-direction.

  Repositories like gnuplot-colorbrewer,[fn:2] and
  gnuplot-palettes[fn:3] host alternative palettes, too.

  + For the display of continuous data, either one of the following
    instructions prior to the =[s]plot= instruction may initiate
    palettes already included in gnuplot:
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      set palette gray   # gnuplot's gray palette
      set pm3d map       # access to gnuplot's default rainbow palette
      set palette cubehelix start 0 cycles -1. saturation 1
    #+END_SRC
    Note that palette =cubehelix= equally counters some cases of color
    blindness, too.

  + For diverge data, using a blue-white-red transient is a good
    choice /to begin with/.  For the RGB color space by the pngcairo
    terminal, these palettes may be defined by 'named colors' as with
    either of the example instructions below.  Similar as seen with
    Moreland's palettes, it is helpful to decrease the maximal
    luminosity, though (second example).
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      set palette defined (-1 "blue", 0 "white", 1 "red")
      set palette defined (-1 "blue", 0 "light-gray", 1 "red")

* Generation of the data

  Departing from Moreland's RGB palettes defined as /floating
  numbers/, script =csv2plt.py= (sub-folder =tools=) reformatted the
  entries to five decimals.  Script =RGB_check.py= provided a control
  if the RGB tuples converted stay within the permitted interval of
  $[0,1]$.

  Script =palette_decomposition.py= provided a quick channel-wise
  decomposition of the RGB color space, complemented by the NTSC
  luminosity.  Each synopsis per =.plt= file displays this result in
  between the test plots in color and gray-scale.

  Script =bessel_test_center.py= computed the synthetic data of the
  Bessel function $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ eventually displayed as color
  plot.  It called ImageMagick to convert this result into gray-scale,
  and concatenated the two plots with the diagram by
  =palette_decomposition.py=.

* Comparison of similar palettes

  Gnuplot's rapid scrutiny about the contribution of =R=, =G=, and =B=
  channel of a palette, reported as =.png=, allows a programmatic
  visual comparison of palettes with each other.  This task addressed
  by script =vignette_comparison.py=, to be run right after
  =palette_decomposition.py=, without provision of parameters from the
  CLI by
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    python3 vignette_comparison.py
  #+END_SRC
  
  Each pairwise comparison yields a new file named in the pattern of
  =diff_fileA_fileB.png=.  Differences identified by ImageMagick will
  be indicated with bright red pixels.  This reveals, for example,
  palette =magma.pal= provided by gnuplotting.org[fn:4] /
  [[https://github.com/Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes][gnuplot-palettes]] differs from all =magma.plt= definitions derived
  from Kenneth Moreland's palettes based on floating numbers in this
  repository as illustrated below, or with animation =magma_diff.gif=
  (in sub-folder =extra_palette_tests=).

  #+NAME:       magma_testing
  #+CAPTION:    Comparison of two =magma= palettes: Kenneth Moreland's =magma= palette (256Â colors, floating RGB definition, left hand side).

  Sub-folder =extra_palette_tests/magma_testing/= includes further
  details about this analysis and an animated =.gif= about all tests
  performed relevant here.  This and all other data processing was
  run under Linux (Xubuntu 18.04.3Â LTS) with CPython (3.6.8,
  OctoberÂ 7, 2019), gnuplot (5.2.7beta, last modified 2019-05-14), and
  ImageMagick (6.9.7-4Â Q16).

* Vector-based export

  It is possible to engage gnuplot's =set terminal pdfcairo=
  instruction to provide a native export of the results as the
  resolution independent =.pdf= format.  This was tested for the
  palette maps of 512Â explicitly defined colors with now 256Â iso
  samples computed by gnuplot for the same Bessel function.  While
  this document contains only the example for the continuously smooth
  viridis palette, tests with this and the other palettes are stored
  in sub-folder =pdf-tests=.
